= response_for

response_for (see Ardes::ResponseFor::ClassMethods) allows you to decorate the respond_to block of actions on sublcassed controllers.  This works nicely with http://plugins.ardes.com/doc/resources_controller

== Important for rails 2.0.x users

If you are on 2.0.2 or 2.0-stable, you must checkout the 2.0-stable branch of response_for.

Edge users should use the master branch.

=== Example

  class FooController < ApplicationController
    def index
      @foos = Foo.find(:all)
    end
    
    def show
      @foo = Foo.find(params[:id])
    end
  end
  
  # this controller needs to respond_to fbml on index, and
  # js, html and xml (templates) on index and show
  class SpecialFooController < FooController
    response_for :index do |format|
      format.fbml { render :inline => turn_into_facebook(@foos) }
    end
    
    response_for :index, :show, :types => [:html, :xml, :js]
  end
  
=== works with rails 2.0-stable and edge

response_for works with rails 2 and edge.

=== Specs and Coverage

* The SPECDOC lists the specifications
* Coverage is 100% (C0), and the spec suite is quite comprehensive

RSpec is used for testing, so the tests are in <tt>spec/</tt> rather than
<tt>test/</tt> Do rake --tasks for more details.

=== Continuous Integration

garlic (at http://github.com/ianwhite/garlic) is used for CI.  To run the CI suite have a look at
